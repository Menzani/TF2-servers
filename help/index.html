</head>
<body>
<p>
    When you are ready to buy a product, send the corresponding amount via PayPal to <code>pay@fmenza.it</code>.
    <br><br>
    Once the purchase is complete, you'll receive your server's connect information and RCON password.
    <br>
    Then you can put that into the create lobby form on TF2Center, or use it to send RCON commands if you need to.
    <br>
    To send RCON commands while you are in game, add <code>rcon_password &lt;your password&gt;</code> to your <code>autoexec.cfg</code>
    file.
    <br><br>
    To request modifications to your server configuration (for example if you do not want DM in pre-game),<br>
    to report issues with your server and for general assistance, contact <code>support@tf2lobby.eu</code>.
    <br><br>
    You are asked the following information upon delivery of your server:
    <br>- Your email
    <br>- The name of your server
</p>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h3>Server</h3>
<p>
    <b>Do I have to configure my server after purchase?</b>
    <br>
    No. The standard packages are perfect for use with TF2Center; for anything else, let us know and we'll manage it for
    you.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Can I use my Highlander server to host 6s matches?</b>
    <br>
    Yes, but you will have to execute the proper config for maps like Product which are configured for Highlander by default.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Which configs are installed on my server?</b>
    <br>
    The standard packages come with ETF2L configs pre-installed.
</p>
<p>
    <b>How do I update my server right away?</b>
    <br>
    If a TF2 update comes out and it needs to be applied immediately, restart your server (<code>rcon quit</code> and
    wait 20 seconds) to apply it.
</p>
<p>
    <b>What do I do if there are problems with my server?</b>
    <br>
    First, restart it (<code>rcon quit</code>) and if the problem persists, contact support.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Why wasn't my demo uploaded?</b>
    <br>
    If you restart your server immediately after the match has ended, the demo might not be uploaded.
</p>
<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>
    <b>Which payment methods do you accept?</b>
    <br>
    You can pay through PayPal.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Can I setup recurring payments?</b>
    <br>
    No, but you can prepay for up to 3 months, and you will always be notified when one of your products is going to expire.
